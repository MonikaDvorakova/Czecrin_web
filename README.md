# Czecrin_web

The repository contains demonstration of my work for the organization Czecrin (https://www.czecrin.cz/).
The web is made in Wix (https://www.wix.com). I was asked to add some functionalities to some pages.

* The file "klinicke_studie_databaze.js" contains code, which I wrote for the page: https://www.czecrin.cz/databaze-klinickych-studii.
The page displays a table of the clinical studies which are part of the Czecrin foundation.
The studies in the table can be filtered by the different values and can be searched by their name.

* The file "probehle_akce.js" contains code, which I wrote for the page: https://www.czecrin.cz/2019-akce1.
It filters out data from the database of the past events, so that only data for selected year are displayed.
It automatizes display of the data according to the information in the database.
